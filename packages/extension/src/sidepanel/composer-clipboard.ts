 * persists a small whitelist of flavours (text/plain, text/html, image/png…), so a custom
 * MIME type is gone the moment the paste happens in another document — and it
 * would leak internal markers into other apps. Instead the extension remembers
 * `{text, attachments}` for a short while and restores the attachments when a paste brings
 * back exactly that text: copy the whole composer, paste it into another session, and the
 * files come with it.
 *
 * The DOM-free half lives here so it can be unit tested; the "is everything selected?"
 * check and the storage glue sit with the composer.
